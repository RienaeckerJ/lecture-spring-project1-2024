## Homework assignment "Create a simple repository" for open-source energy system modelling course at TU Wien

The "simple repository" includes six python files (three files with actual functions and three files with test functions). The two files "utils" and "utils2" include basic functions to calculate two numbers (add, substract, multiply and divide). The file "utils3" has a function which receives a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of the squares of the even numbers in the list. In the main file, the functions can be called and executed.
